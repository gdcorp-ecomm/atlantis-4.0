If you buy this stuff now, then you can have it for [@T[testsimple:58]@T].  If you want to do something fancy 
then [@T[testjson:{"glossary": 
{ "title" : "blah"}}]@T].  Then you are done.
You may also want to put in some xml with this [@T[testxml:<instruction active="1">Hello</instruction>]@T]
really?
This token shows up more than once: [@T[testsimple:58]@T]
This token is served by a dyamic handler: [@T[testdynamic1:58]@T]
Another xml token but not a duplicate: [@T[testxml:<instruction active="1">Aloha</instruction>]@T]
The end.
